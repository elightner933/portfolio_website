				<h2>My Goals</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;I am an aspiring video game designer. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software and Mobile Applications Development and I am currently taking classes on Full-Stack Web Development. My plan is to make websites for local businesses to start making money while I learn how to program video games. I will be saving money while I develop websites so that I can open my own business for video game development.

				<h2>My History</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;I first became interested in video games when I was around 8 years old. I would sit and play video games for hours and always wondered how they were made. When I was in highschool, I was playing a pokemon game on an online gameboy emulator and was using cheat codes to make the pokemon I encountered specific levels. The level that I wanted the pokemon to be was not included in the list of cheat codes that I had, so I did some research. The cheat codes that I were using were in hexadecimal format. After comparing the different cheat codes that pertained to the level of the pokemon, I figured out what section actually effected the level of the pokemon I encountered. I translated the hexadecimal code into decimal, did a little bit of math, and translated it back into hexadecimal and the new cheat code allowed me to encounter pokemon of the level that I was wanting.

					&emsp;After I was out of school, I attempted to go to college for Psychology, which is what I thought that I wanted to do. After dropping out, due to failing grades, I did not want to go back to college. My mom kept insisting that I go back to college for Information Technology, since I have been interested in it since I was a kid. I finally contacted University of Phoenix and enrolled in their Information Technology program. After going to this college for a couple of months, I dropped out again due to failing grades. The courses in this program could not keep my interest. Again, I did not want to go back to college because I did not think that there was a program that would keep my interest enough to pass the classes.

					&emsp;I was out of college for several months when I was scrolling through Instagram and saw a link to a college that would teach me how to program. I contacted the college and they told me about their Software and Mobile Applications program. I would learn how to program in multiple languages and learn a little bit of Web Development as well. I enrolled in the program at Independence University. I graduated in June of 2021, 3 years after enrolling, with a Bachelor's Degree. I did some job searching, but no one was willing to hire someone who just graduated college and did not have any software development work experience. I move to a small town in Kansas with a couple of friends and realized that the businesses in this town had poorly put together websites, if they even had one at all. I decided to start taking classes on Full-Stack Web Development so that I could make a little bit of money building websites for the local businesses.
